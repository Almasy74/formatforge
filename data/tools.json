Whether you are preparing a clean prompt for an AI model, normalizing scraped web content for a spreadsheet, or simply fixing a broken paragraph from a Word document, you can choose exactly how transitions are handled. You can replace breaks with a single space to create a flowing sentence or strip them entirely for dense data payloads.

Our URL Encoder / Decoder is a precision workshop utility designed to sanitize your strings, ensuring they are perfectly escaped for safe, reliable web transmission.",

Many online tools track your data or have slow, ad-heavy interfaces. FormatForge provides a zero-latency, local-first environment where your sensitive API endpoints, webhook URLs, and parameters are decoded or encoded entirely in your browser. This guarantees that your data never touches the network until you are ready to use it.",
