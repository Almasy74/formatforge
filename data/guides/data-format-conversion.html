<h2>Tabular vs. Hierarchical Data</h2>
<p>Choosing between CSV and JSON isn't about which is "better"—it's about which structure fits your specific use case.
    Professional developers often find themselves needing to jump between these two worlds constantly.</p>

<h2>When to Use CSV (Comma-Separated Values)</h2>
<p>CSV is the king of tabular data. It is the format used by Excel, Google Sheets, and almost every database export
    tool. It is <strong>flat</strong>, meaning it represents a grid of rows and columns.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Extremely compact, readable by non-technical users, and easy to import into analytical
        software.</li>
    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Cannot represent complex, nested relationships or metadata.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</h2>
<p>JSON is the standard for web applications and APIs. It is <strong>hierarchical</strong>, meaning a single record can
    contain other objects or lists (arrays) nested inside it.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Can represent complex data structures, natively supported by web browsers and modern
        programming languages.</li>
    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Larger file sizes due to repetitive keys, harder for humans to scan in large quantities.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Conversion Pitfalls</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge in converting CSV to JSON (and vice versa) is <strong>handling the hierarchy.</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Flattening JSON:</strong> When moving from JSON to CSV, nested objects must be "flattened" into multiple
        columns. This can lead to data loss if not handled systematically.</li>
    <li><strong>Parsing Types:</strong> CSV doesn't distinguish between strings and numbers. A good converter must
        decide if "123" is a text ID or a numerical value during the JSON generation process.</li>
    <li><strong>Encoding Errors:</strong> Since CSVs often come from diverse local systems (like a Norwegian Excel
        export using semicolons), your converter needs to be flexible with delimiters and character sets.</li>
</ol>
