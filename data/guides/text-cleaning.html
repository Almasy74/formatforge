<h2>What is Text Cleaning?</h2>
<p>Text cleaning (or text normalization) is the process of converting raw, messy text into a clean, standardized format.
    In the age of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Big Data, text cleaning has become an essential skill for anyone
    working with digital information. Messy data lead to poor search rankings, broken code, and inaccurate AI responses.

<h2>The 4 Pillars of a Clean Dataset</h2>

<h3>1. Removing Formatting Artifacts</h3>
<p>When text is copied from the web or PDFs, it often brings hidden baggage: HTML tags, non-standard line breaks, and
    invisible BOM (Byte Order Mark) characters. These must be stripped before the text can be used in a professional
    context.</p>

<h3>2. Eliminating Duplicates</h3>
<p>Duplicate lines are more than just a nuisance; they skew data analysis and waste resources. Whether it's a list of
    email addresses, product SKUs, or keywords, deduplication ensures you are working with a unique set of high-quality
    data.</p>

<h3>3. Standardizing White Space</h3>
<p>Inconsistent spacing (Double spaces, tabs instead of spaces, trailing whitespace) can break password checks, search
    queries, and code execution. A clean text workshop ensures every space is intentional.</p>

<h3>4. Normalizing Encoding</h3>
<p>Text from different sources often uses different encoding (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, etc.). Normalizing your text ensures
    that special characters like emojis or diacritics don't turn into broken symbols (garbage characters like ).</p>

<h2>Advanced Cleaning: Regex and AI</h2>
<p>For complex patterns, <strong>Regular Expressions</strong> are the gold standard. They allow you to define rules like
    "remove everything between these two tags" or "find all phone numbers." For more nuanced cleaning, AI models can now
    be used to rewrite and prune text while keeping the core meaning intact.</p>
