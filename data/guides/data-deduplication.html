<h2>Precision Cleaning: Advanced Data Deduplication Strategies</h2>
<p>Removing exact duplicates is the baseline for any data workshop. However, real-world data is rarely that clean.
    Strategic deduplication requires <strong>Normalization Keys</strong>—transforming records into a "lowest common
    denominator" before performing the uniqueness check.</p>

    <h3>The "Dirty List" Debugging Case</h3>
    <p>Consider a list of URLs where some have trailing slashes, some have `https://`, and others `www.`. An exact-match
        deduplicator would miss these. Our <a href="/text/remove-duplicate-lines/">Deduplication Workshop</a> encourages
        a "Clean-First" workflow: strip protocols, lowercase, and remove trailing slashes before running the uniqueness
        filter.</p>

<h3>Practical Example: The Normalization Key</h3>
<pre><code>// Raw Input
" Google.com "
"google.com/"
"https://google.com"

// Normalization (Lower + Trim + Path Strip)
"google.com" (Unique Key)</code></pre>

<h2>Bidirectional Strategy: Deduplicate → Diff</h2>
<p>A professional cleaning workflow doesn't stop at the filter. After removing duplicates from a massive dataset, use
    the <a href="/text/diff-checker/">Text Diff Workshop</a> to compare the original raw file against the deduplicated
    output. This manual audit ensures that your normalization keys weren't too aggressive and didn't accidentally merge
    distinct records.</p>

<p><strong>Workshop Pro-Tip:</strong> When working with huge CSV exports, always deduplicate by a primary ID (like an
    email or SKU) rather than the entire row. This preserves the "richest" version of the data if two rows have the same
    ID but different metadata.</p>
