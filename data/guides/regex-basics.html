<h2>What is Regex?</h2>
<p>Regular Expressions (Regex) are an incredibly powerful way to find and manipulate text based on patterns. Think of
    them as "Find and Replace" on steroids. While they look like a jumble of random symbols to the uninitiated, they
    follow a strict, logical grammar that can save you hours of manual work.</p>

<h2>The Basic Anatomy of a Regex Pattern</h2>
<p>Regex works by using special characters (metacharacters) to represent groups of text or logical rules.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>.</code> : Matches <strong>any</strong> single character.</li>
    <li><code>\d</code> : Matches any <strong>digit</strong> (0-9).</li>
    <li><code>\w</code> : Matches any <strong>word character</strong> (letters, numbers, underscores).</li>
    <li><code>+</code> : Matches <strong>one or more</strong> of the preceding element.</li>
    <li><code>*</code> : Matches <strong>zero or more</strong>.</li>
    <li><code>[abc]</code> : Matches any one of the characters <strong>a, b, or c</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Examples for Your Daily Work</h2>
<p>Regex is most useful when you have a specific pattern but don't know the exact text. For example:</p>

<h3>Finding Email Addresses</h3>
<p>Instead of searching for "john@example.com," you search for a pattern: <code>[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}</code>.
    This matches virtually any valid email address in a document.</p>

<h3>Cleaning HTML Tags</h3>
<p>To strip all tags from a snippet, the pattern <code><[^>]*></code> tells the computer to find every bracket and
    everything inside it, allowing you to replace them with nothing.</p>

<h2>Why Does Regex Feel So Hard?</h2>
<p>The primary barrier to regex mastery is readability. Because patterns are so concise, they can become unreadable
    quickly. The secret is to build your patterns incrementally, testing each piece as you go.</p>
