<h2>Fixing Broken Sentences: The Remove Line Breaks Guide</h2>
<p>In a technical workshop, removing line breaks isn't just about deleting newlines—it's about <strong>restoring data
        continuity</strong>. Whether you're cleaning text from a legacy PDF or preparing a prompt for an LLM, hard
    returns in the wrong places will break your data pipeline.</p>

<section class="usage-scenario">
    <h3>The "PDF-to-Prompt" Debugging Case</h3>
    <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are sensitive to formatting artifacts. When you copy text from a PDF, it often
        includes "hard line breaks" at the end of every physical line in the document. These breaks are seen by the
        model as end-of-sentence markers or structural breaks, which can confuse the attention mechanism and lead to
        lower-quality reasoning. Using the <a href="/text/remove-line-breaks/">Remove Line Breaks Workshop</a> to
        flatten this text before prompting can significantly improve model performance and token efficiency.</p>

<h3>Practical Example: Cleaning a Fragged Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>// Input (Copy-pasted from PDF)
The architecture of the
system was designed to
handle massive payloads.

// Cleaned Output (FormatForge)
The architecture of the system was designed to handle massive payloads.</code></pre>

<h2>Bidirectional Strategy: Clean → Format</h2>
<p>Removing breaks is often only phase one. Once your text is flattened, you may need to reorganize it structurally. If
    your flattened text is actually a JSON string that was fragmented across multiple lines, your next step should be
    the <a href="/json/json-formatter/">JSON Formatter</a> to restore its hierarchy correctly. This sequence—Flattening
    followed by Re-structuring—is a standard professional data recovery pattern.</p>

<p><strong>Workshop Pro-Tip:</strong> Use "Preserve Double Line Breaks" when you want to flatten sentences but keep the
    separation between paragraphs. This keeps the semantic structure human-readable while making the data machine-ready.
