<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>At FormatForge (“we”, “our”, or “us”), we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. FormatForge
    provides browser-based tools for formatting, cleaning, validating, and transforming text and structured data.</p>
<p>Our tools are designed to operate locally in your browser whenever possible, minimizing data collection and ensuring
    that your information remains under your control.</p>
<p>FormatForge is operated by an independent publisher based in Norway.</p>
<p>By using this website, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>2. Local Data Processing</h2>
<p>Most FormatForge tools process data entirely within your web browser.</p>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data you paste or enter into tools is not uploaded to our servers</li>
    <li>We do not store, monitor, or analyze tool input</li>
    <li>Your data remains on your device unless explicitly stated otherwise</li>
</ul>
<p>If a tool ever requires external processing or third-party requests, this will be clearly indicated within the tool
    interface.</p>

<h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>FormatForge does not require user accounts or registration.</p>
<p>We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or uploaded
    documents.</p>
<p>We may receive limited information automatically through standard web operations, including: IP address, browser
    type, device information, referring pages, and date/time of visits.</p>
<p>This information is used solely for site security, performance monitoring, abuse prevention, and basic analytics. It
    is not linked to individual identities.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>FormatForge tools are primarily client-side and do not rely on external data services. However, the website
    infrastructure (such as hosting or analytics providers) may process technical data required for delivering web
    content securely and efficiently.</p>
<p>If future tools require third-party APIs, those interactions will be disclosed within the relevant tool.</p>

<h2>5. Cookies and Advertising</h2>
<p>FormatForge may use cookies or similar technologies necessary for basic website functionality and performance. In the
    future, we may use third-party advertising services such as Google AdSense to display advertisements.</p>
<p>These services may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to understand visitor interactions, deliver
    relevant advertisements, and measure advertising performance.</p>
<p>Google’s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads based on visits to this and other
    websites. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://adssettings.google.com</a></p>

<h2>6. Log Files</h2>
<p>Like most websites, FormatForge uses standard server log files. These logs may include IP addresses, browser type,
    Internet Service Provider (ISP), timestamps, referring/exit pages, and click counts.</p>
<p>Log data is used exclusively for security monitoring, diagnosing technical issues, and maintaining service
    reliability. This information is not associated with personally identifiable data.</p>

<h2>7. Data Security</h2>
<p>We use commercially reasonable measures to protect website infrastructure and communications. However, no method of
    transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure. Users should therefore avoid entering
    sensitive or confidential information into online tools.</p>

<h2>8. Your Rights (EEA and GDPR)</h2>
<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have rights under applicable data protection laws,
    including the right to request access, correction, deletion, restriction, or objection to processing.</p>
<p>Because FormatForge does not maintain user accounts or store personal tool input, many requests may not apply in
    practice.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision
    date. Continued use of the website constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
