<p>FormatForge is a technical workshop designed for developers, data engineers, and "tech operators" who need precise,
    reliable tools for handling structured data.</p>

<h2>Who Operates This Site?</h2>
<p>FormatForge is built and maintained by an **independent developer based in Norway**. Unlike many online tool
    directories that prioritize ad-revenue over utility, this project was born out of a personal need for a "clean room"
    environment to fix broken JSON, clean legacy CSVs, and audit data pipes without the fear of data logging.</p>

<h2>Our Philosophy: Privacy-First Utility</h2>
<p>The core principle of FormatForge is **local processing**. We believe that your data is yours alone. That is why 99%
    of our tools operate entirely within your web browser. When you paste sensitive API responses or customer data into
    our workshop, that data never touches a server. It stays in your RAM, is transformed by our client-side logic, and
    disappears when you close the tab.</p>

<h2>The FormatForge Mission</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Utility Over Marketing:</strong> We don't write generic "SEO fluff." Our documentation is designed to
        solve real debugging cases.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Precision:</strong> We focus on edge cases—helping you fix trailing commas, Unicode artifacts,
        and schema mismatches.</li>
    <li><strong>Zero Friction:</strong> No accounts, no subscriptions, no data-walls. Just tools that work.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for using the workshop. If you have suggestions for new tools or improvements, feel free to reach out.</p>
